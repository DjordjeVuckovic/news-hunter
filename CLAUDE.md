# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

News Hunter is a full-text search engine for exploring multilingual news headlines and articles. The project uses Go 1.24 and focuses on importing, processing, and storing news data from various sources (currently Kaggle datasets).

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **cmd/**: Entry points for different operations
  - `data_import/`: Imports News datasets into the database
  - `news_search/`: HTTP API server for search functionality
  - `schemagen/`: Schema generation utilities

- **internal/**: Core business logic organized by domain
  - `domain/`: Core data structures (Article, ArticleMetadata, Query)
  - `reader/`: CSV reading and YAML configuration mapping
  - `collector/`: Article collection orchestration
  - `processor/`: Article processing logic
  - `storage/`: Storage abstractions and implementations
    - `factory/`: Storage factory for creating storage instances
    - `pg/`: PostgreSQL storage implementation with full-text search
    - `es/`: Elasticsearch storage implementation
  - `server/`: HTTP server configuration and setup
  - `router/`: HTTP route handlers
  - `middleware/`: HTTP middleware (logging, etc.)

- **pkg/**: Shared packages and APIs
  - `apis/datamapping/`: Data mapping type definitions
  - `schema/`: Schema generation utilities

- **api/**: API schemas and examples
  - Data mapping configuration examples and JSON schemas


- **configs/**: Configuration files
  - `mappings/`: YAML configuration files for data field mappings
  - `elasticsearch/`: Elasticsearch configuration (index templates, ILM policies)
- **db/**: Database-related files
  - `migrations/`: SQL migration files for database schema
  - `query/`: SQL query files for database operations
- **dataset/**: Sample datasets and documentation
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for setup and maintenance

## Key Components

### Data Mapping System
The project uses YAML configuration files to map source data fields to internal Article structure. Configuration files follow the DataMapping schema with fieldMappings that specify source/target fields and their types.

### Storage Layer
Follows idiomatic Go patterns with sub-package organization:
- **Interfaces**: `Reader` and `Storer` interfaces define storage contracts
- **Factory Pattern**: `storage/factory` package provides centralized creation logic
- **PostgreSQL**: `storage/pg` - Full-text search with tsvector, ranking, and pagination
- **Elasticsearch**: `storage/es` - Multilingual search with advanced indexing
- **In-memory**: Built-in implementation for development/testing

**Key Features**:
- SearchResult with pagination metadata (total, hasMore, page info)
- PostgreSQL uses native tsvector with ts_rank for relevance scoring
- Factory pattern avoids import cycles while maintaining clean separation

### Pipeline Architecture
Uses a pipeline pattern for data processing with common interfaces:
1. Reader loads and parses source data
2. Mapper transforms data according to configuration
3. Collector orchestrates the process
4. Factory creates storage instances based on configuration
5. Storage persists the articles with bulk operations support

### HTTP API Server
Built with Echo framework providing:
- **Search API**: Full-text search with pagination, ranking, and filtering
- **Health Checks**: Database connectivity and service health monitoring
- **Middleware**: CORS support, request logging, and error recovery
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup on termination

**Search Features**:
- Basic keyword search with relevance ranking
- Pagination with total count and hasMore indicators
- Input validation and error handling
- PostgreSQL tsvector-based full-text search

## Development Commands

### Database
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker-compose up -d

# Database runs on port 54320 with:
# - Database: news_db
# - User: news_user
# - Password: news_password
```

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build specific command
go build -o bin/data-import ./cmd/data_import

# Run with environment variables
go run ./cmd/data_import

# Build other commands
go build -o bin/schemagen ./cmd/schemagen
go build -o bin/news-search ./cmd/news_search

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/reader

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Vet code
go vet ./...
```

### Environment Setup
Commands expect environment variables (typically in `.env` files):

**Data Import (`cmd/data_import/.env`)**:
- `STORAGE_TYPE`: Storage backend (`pg`, `es`, `in_mem`)
- `MAPPING_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to YAML mapping configuration
- `DATASET_PATH`: Path to source dataset file
- `PG_CONNECTION_STRING`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `ES_ADDRESSES`: Elasticsearch cluster addresses (comma-separated)
- `ES_INDEX_NAME`: Elasticsearch index name
- `BULK_ENABLED`: Enable bulk operations (`true`/`false`)
- `BULK_SIZE`: Bulk operation batch size

**Search API (`cmd/news_search/.env`)**:
- `PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8080)
- `USE_HTTP2`: Enable HTTP/2 support (`true`/`false`)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated)

## Testing
Tests are located alongside source files with `_test.go` suffix. Use standard Go testing patterns:
- `go test ./...` - Run all tests
- `go test -v ./internal/reader` - Run specific package tests with verbose output
